This is the program for Take Home Assignment #1.
It first asks the user if they want to use Metric or USC.
First, if they chose USC, I ask for distance and gasoline in those units and convert it to metric.
Else, if they chose Metric, I ask for those units instead and convert it to USC.
Else, I tell the user their input was invalid and exit.
Next, I calculate fuel consumption in both units.
Then, I check their consumption in Metric to assign an efficiency rating
Finally, I print all the information formatted in a table.
I do not think there were any other notes or issues I need to make you aware of.
Thank you!
