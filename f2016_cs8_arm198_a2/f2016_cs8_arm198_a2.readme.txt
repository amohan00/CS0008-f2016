Hello Max!
To begin with, the only problem I ran into was when I tried opening a file, as pycharm would tell me that the file
or directory could not be found, no matter what I tried.
In my program, I first define the two functions. In processFile, I use a 'for' loop to go through each line of the file,
cut off the ''\n' at the end of each line, split the line to separate the distance, and add the distance to the counter.
In printKV, I first check if the key has more characters than the key length, and assign a variable to whichever one is
longer. Then, I check the data type of the value and assign a variable to the corresponding data type. Finally, I print
the information with the formatting.
Next, I use a 'while' loop to ask the user for their file. I call processFile to count the lines and distance of
each file. I call printKV to print all the information in the correct format.
