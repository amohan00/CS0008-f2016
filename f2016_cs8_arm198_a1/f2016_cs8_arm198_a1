# Description:
# Assignment 1, program that helps the user understand their gas mileage

# Here I ask the user what system to use
system = input("Enter 'U' to use USC or 'M' to use Metric: ");
# Here I check if the user picked USC and ask for their info in those units
if (system == "U" or system == "u"):
    miles = float(input("Enter the amount of miles traveled using only numbers: "))
    gallons = float(input("Enter how many gallons were used using only numbers: "))
# Here I convert USC to Metric
    km = miles*1.60934
    liters = gallons*3.78541
# Here I checked if the user picked Metric and ask for their info in those units
elif (system == "M" or system == "m"):
    km = float(input("Enter the amount of kilometers traveled using only numbers: "))
    liters = float(input("Enter how many liters were used using only numbers: "))
# Here I convert Metric to USC
    miles = km * 0.621371
    gallons = liters * 0.264172
#Here I tell the user if their input was invalid
else:
    print("Sorry, Invalid Input!");
    exit();
# I calculate fuel consumption in both units
mpg = miles/gallons;
lpk = (100*liters)/km;
# Here I print all the information in the correct format
print (format("", '17s'), format("USC", '12s'), "Metric");
print (format("Distance", '12s'), ":", format(miles, '9.3f'), "Miles");
